# Linear Regression
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the implementation and analysis of linear regression, a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm.

## Overview
Linear regression computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Key Features
## Epoch Analysis:

Examines the impact of the number of epochs on model performance.
Implements early stopping to avoid unnecessary computation if the change in loss is minimal.

## Data Analysis:

Utilizes the Iris dataset for experimentation.
Includes data loading, exploration, and descriptive statistics.

## Code Implementation:

Written in Python with commonly used libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.
Demonstrates training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
