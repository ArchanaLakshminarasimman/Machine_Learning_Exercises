# Perceptron Model in Machine Learning
This repository contains an implementation of the Perceptron model, a fundamental supervised learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. The Perceptron is modeled after a simple computational unit in the brain and can adjust its parameters to learn from examples and improve accuracy.

## Overview
The Perceptron algorithm is used to classify linearly separable data. In this project, the focus is on exploring the Perceptron model for the classification of two Iris species: versicolor and virginica, using the features sepal length and petal length.

## Key Questions Addressed:
Convergence of Perceptron: Analyze the convergence properties of the Perceptron for linearly separable data.
Decision Boundaries: Visualize the decision regions for the Iris dataset using the Perceptron model.
Dataset
The dataset used is the Iris Dataset, which contains the following features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

Target labels:

versicolor
virginica

## Steps
## Data Preprocessing:

Load and explore the Iris dataset.
Filter the data for the selected species and features.

## Model Implementation:

Train a Perceptron model using scikit-learn on the selected features.
Visualize decision boundaries using mlxtend.

## Analysis:
