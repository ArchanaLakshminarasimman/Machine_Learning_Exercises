Practice of Basic Machine Learning Alogrithms
  1. Perceptron
  2. Linear Regression
  3. Logistic Regression
  4. Artificial Neural Networks
  5. Decision Trees
  6. K Nearest Neighbor
  7. Support Vector Machine
  8. Naive Bayes
  9. Clustering
      
Implemented the algotithms using sckit-learn libraries and optimized the hyper-parameters using GridSearch/RandomSearch Cross validation and achieved less RMSE errors (in regression problems) and high accuracy (in classification problems)
